Security Concerns:
- Script Injection
    - value set outside a workflow used in a workflow
        e.g., issue title used in a workflow shell command
    - workflow/command behaviour could be changed
- Malicious 3rd Party Actions
    - actions can perform any logic, including potentially malicious logic
        - e.g., 3rd party action that reads and exports your secrets
    - only truted actions and inspect code of unknown / untrusted authors
Permission Issues
    - consider avoiding overly permissive permissions
        e.g., only allow checking out code ("read-only")
    - Github Actions supports fine-grained permissions control
