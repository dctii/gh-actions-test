Why?
- simplify workflow steps
- instead of writing multiple (possibly very complex) step definitions, you can build and us a single custom action
- multiple steps can be grouped into a single custom action

- No existing community action
    - existing actions may not solve the specific problem you have in your workflow
    - maybe you want more control over the action
    -
