Why?
- simplify workflow steps
- instead of writing multiple (possibly very complex) step definitions, you can build and us a single custom action
- multiple steps can be grouped into a single custom action

- No existing community action
    - existing actions may not solve the specific problem you have in your workflow
    - maybe you want more control over the action

- Different types of custom actions
    - JavaScript Actions: execute JS file, uses JS (NodeJS and any packages)
    - Docker actions:
        - a containerized action - create Dockerfile with your required configuration
        - Perform any task of your choice with any language
        - Lots of flexibility but requires Docker knowledge
    - Composite actions
        - combine multiple Workflow steps in one single action
        - combine run (commands) and uses (Actions)
        - allows for reusing shared steps (without extra skills)
