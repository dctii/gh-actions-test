Docker
- packages that contain code + its execution environment
- advantage: reproducible execution env and results
- guarantee it always runs the same way even if on different operating systems
- for example, run windows on an ubuntu-latest server

Why use the container over the runner?
- CONTAINER
    - full control over environment & installed software

- RUNNER
    - choose from list of pre-defined environments (incl. installed software)
    - steps execute inside the container
    - can create "Services": utility containers used by your steps
