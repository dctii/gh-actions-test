# cron: 'MIN HOUR DOTM MONTH DOTW'
# eg, "30 19 30 7 7" means  "the 30th minute of the hour of 7 PM on the 30th day of July on a Sunday"
# use '*' to omit specificity for that column. If all '*' for each column, it means the task should run every minute of every hour of every day of the month, every month, and every day of the week
