Example issue:
- e.g. Run tests, should not manipulation production db
    - solution: use a testing db with a service container


Service container:
    - Runs inside a container
    - runs extra services side-by-side with your jobs and their steps
    - run db in container
    - job steps can communicate with service containers (and the services exposed by them)
